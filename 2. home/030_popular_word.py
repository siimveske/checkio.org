"""
Determine the popularity of certain words in the text:
    - The words should be sought in all registers. This means that if you need to find a word "one" then words like "one", "One", "oNe", "ONE" etc. will do.
    - The search words are always indicated in the lowercase.
    - If the word wasnâ€™t found even once, it has to be returned in the dictionary with 0 (zero) value.
